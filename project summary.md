# **SYN Flood Attack Detection Using Machine Learning**

---

## **1. Business Understanding**

SYN Flood attacks are a major cybersecurity threat, causing service outages, degraded performance, and financial losses.
Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often rely on static rules and signatures, which struggle to adapt to evolving attack strategies.

This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** to build a scalable, robust, and interpretable IDS for detecting SYN Flood (DrDoS\_DNS) attacks in real-time network traffic.

---

## **2. Objectives**

1. **Build ML models** to classify network flows as benign or SYN Flood attack.
2. **Evaluate models** using multiple metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity.
3. **Identify key traffic features** for better understanding of attack behavior and to guide IDS design.
4. **Deploy the best-performing model** for practical use in real-time systems.

## **3. Data Overview**

* **Dataset size:** 6703 network flows
* **Features:** 78 predictors including packet counts, flag counts (SYN, ACK, PSH, etc.), flow durations, rates, and packet length statistics
* **Label:** Binary (Benign = 0, DrDoS\_DNS = 1)
* **Class balance:** Almost balanced (Benign: 3034, Attack: 3669)
* **Missing values:** None â€“ dataset is complete

---

## **4. Data Preparation**

* **Encoding:** Label encoded (Benign = 0, Attack = 1).
* **Correlation-based feature reduction:** Highly correlated features (|corr| > 0.95) dropped to avoid redundancy and overfitting.
* **Scaling:** StandardScaler applied to standardize numeric features.
* **Train-test split:** 70% training, 30% testing, stratified to maintain class balance.

## **5. Modeling & Evaluation**

### **Algorithms tested**

* **Ensemble:** Random Forest, Extra Trees
* **Boosting:** XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
* **Kernel-based:** SVM (RBF kernel)
* **Distance-based:** K-Nearest Neighbors (optional tested variant)
* **ANN (Neural Net):** Simple feed-forward baseline

### **Performance Results**

* **ROC-AUC:** All models > 0.99
* **Best ROC-AUC:** 0.9998 (boosting/ensemble models)
* **Accuracy:** > 99% for all models
* **Sensitivity (Recall):** Up to **99.7%** â†’ Very few attacks missed
* **Specificity:** Up to **99.7%** â†’ Very few false alarms
* **Final model selection:** Based on ROC-AUC â†’ Accuracy â†’ Precision
